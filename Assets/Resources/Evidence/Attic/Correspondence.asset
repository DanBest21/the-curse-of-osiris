  description: "A French frock coat, very fancy. What\u2019s this? Something is in
    the pocket! A note that reads: \n\r\n\u201CHey boss, we\u2019re all pleased to
    hear from you! \r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve been keeping busy with odd jobs whilst you\u2019ve
    been away, managed to snag a Ming Dynasty vase from some foolish Triad goons
    in San Francisco last week. It\u2019s sure to fetch a pretty penny on the black
    market, and of course, we\u2019ll share all the loot as usual.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m
    glad to hear your plan is progressing well, and that you\u2019re close to the
    staff. Posing as a butler was ingenious, an easy way to get close to that foolish
    noble. Soon all will know how the great Pedro Lopes swindled the most prolific
    archeologist of our generation. Of course, we\u2019ll also be rich beyond imaging
    when we fence that staff.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ll see you soon boss.\r\n\r\nEnrico\u201D\r\n\nMy
    word, it looks like Jeffery is not who he seems. Maybe the butler did it, that
    would be a first!\r\n"
