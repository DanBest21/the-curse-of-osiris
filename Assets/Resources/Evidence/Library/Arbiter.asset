  description: "I know this book very well, it was written by Henry\u2019s mentor,
    Lord Bartholomew Princeton, who also searched for the staff. It depicts the story
    of Osiris, the Egyptian god of the underworld, and his brother Set, the god of
    the desert, storms, disorder and violence. A section appears to have been marked:\r\n\n\"The
    known curse of eternal damnation is not the only rumoured side effect of possession
    of the staff. It is said that the next born daughter of he who possesses the
    staff would become corrupted by the Curse of Osiris. Wtih his dying breath, Osiris
    cursed his brother, such that his next born child would be evil incarnate, and
    destined to kill him. What Osiris did not plan for is that Set forcefuly took
    Osiris's wife as his own. Luckily for Isis and Set, this did not come to pass,
    as Isis soon gave birth to a son, who was fathered by Osiris before his death:
    Horus. However, in a way the prophecy was still fulfilled, as it was Horus who
    defeated his uncle for good when he came of age.\u201D\n\nWas it Henry who was
    interested in this passage? Did he believe this curse was plaguing him?\r"
