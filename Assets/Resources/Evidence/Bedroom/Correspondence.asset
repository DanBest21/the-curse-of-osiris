  description: "A letter from Henry\u2019s lawyer discussing his will:\r\n\n\u201CMy
    Lord Duke,\r\n\r\nAs requested, I have made the necessary modifications to your
    will to ensure that Lord Eric Crane of Hampshire does not receive control of
    your business operations. Instead they will be sold to the highest bidder, with
    the proceedings all then being donated to the British Museum.\n\r\nPlease let
    me know if there is anything else I can do to help, I am always at your service.\r\n\r\nYours
    sincerely,\r\n\r\nMr Timothy Wallace\r\nWallace & Associates Law Firm\u201D\r\n\nSo
    Henry was, at least partially, writing his son out of his will? That\u2019s certainly
    could be a motive for his murder."
