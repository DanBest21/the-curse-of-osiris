  description: "A book that concerns the seven ancient wonders of the world: the
    Colossus of Rhodes, the Lighthouse of Alexandria, the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus,
    the Great Pyramid of Giza, the Temple of Artemis, the Statue of Zeus and the
    Hanging Gardens of Babylon. It\u2019s a common misconception that all three of
    the pyramids of Giza are wonders, just the Pyramid of Khufu is, but I digress."
