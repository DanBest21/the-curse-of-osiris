  description: "A note addressed to me?!\r\n\n\u201CJim,\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re reading
    this, then my worst come fears have been realised. I entrust the staff to you.
    Go to the wine cellar and open the secret vault. You need a code to open it,
    I\u2019ve written the rest in hieroglyphics to make sure it is you who is attempting
    to solve my riddle.\r\"\n\nTranslated, the hieroglyphics read:\n\r\n\"A Sheet
    of Sound\r\nAn Enemy of Birds\r\nA Teller of Time\r\nThe Great Pyramid and its
    Siblings\u201D\r\n\nFour clues, perhaps each of them corresponds to a number?\r"
