    sentence: "A French frock coat, very fancy. What\u2019s this? Something is in
      the pocket! A note that reads:\n\n\u201CHey boss, we\u2019re all pleased to
      hear from you! "
  - character: {fileID: 0}
    sentence: "We\u2019ve been keeping busy with odd jobs whilst you\u2019ve been
      away, managed to snag a Ming Dynasty vase from some foolish Triad goons in
      San Francisco last week. It\u2019s sure to fetch a pretty penny on the black
      market, and of course, we\u2019ll share all the loot as usual."

    sentence: "I\u2019m glad to hear your plan is progressing well, and that you\u2019re
      close to the staff. Posing as a butler was ingenious, an easy way to get close
      to that foolish noble. Soon all will know how the great Pedro Lopes swindled
      the most prolific archeologist of our generation. Of course, we\u2019ll also
      be rich beyond imaging when we fence that staff."

    sentence: My word, it looks like Jeffery is not who he seems. Maybe the butler
      did it, that would be a first!
