  - character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 7dc48e8458df8024388fcc89cc52c90d, type: 2}
    sentence: Henry found out a few days ago, which was a tad inconvenient. There

  - character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 62067f6e33a936f408b5813710f123b2, type: 2}
    sentence: "Which is why Henry decided to give it to me before you could take
      it. But he didn\u2019t count on the unthinkable. He didn\u2019t count on his
      own daughter murdering him. The only question remaining was why? Why did you
      kill him?"

    sentence: And then it hit me. The Curse of Osiris. It is said that with his dying
      breath, Osiris placed upon his murderer, his brother Set, a curse that would
      cause his next born daughter to suffer unimaginable torment until she killed
      her own father.

    sentence: "Luckily for Set, this never came to pass, since Osiris\u2019 own son
      avenged him before these events could come to pass. But legend states that
      the curse carried down to the legendary Staff of Osiris, and that the wielder
      of it would suffer the same fate. Of course, this is all mythos to most of
      us, but not to Henry. Isn\u2019t that right, Anna?"
  - character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 228e4b94c6d707c4c86ad7fc15c524ac, type: 2}
    sentence: My entire life, he treated me like a burden! Like some problem to be
      dealt with rather than his actual daughter. He was convinced I was the spawn
      of the devil, cursed to be evil incarnate!
  - character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 228e4b94c6d707c4c86ad7fc15c524ac, type: 2}
    sentence: Do you have any idea what that is like? So yes, I killed him. I killed
      him because he thought I was irredeemable, because by getting rid of that staff,
      it symbolised he had finally given up on me. And I had given up on him.
  - character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 19d27bb4ef9945549930bf1b387fd035, type: 2}

    sentence: "You have no idea what it was like to suffer just because of some old
      tomes and tomb enscribings. I\u2019m sorry I caused you two pain, but I don\u2019t
      regret what I did."
  - character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 62067f6e33a936f408b5813710f123b2, type: 2}
    sentence: "You\u2019re right. I can\u2019t begin to understand what that must
      have been like. The damage it must have done. But it does not justify your
      actions either. You will have to answer for your crimes. As will you, Mr Lopes."

      the truth hurts more than not knowing it at all.

    sentence: "I just can\u2019t believe my own sister would be behind something
      like this. Someone I have loved my entire life, capable of something so disturbing."
  - character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 62067f6e33a936f408b5813710f123b2, type: 2}
    sentence: It seems as if the emotional abuse that your father gave to her eventually
      weighed its toll, and this was the end result.
  - character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 19d27bb4ef9945549930bf1b387fd035, type: 2}

      here anytime my friend."
