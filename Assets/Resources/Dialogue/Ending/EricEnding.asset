    sentence: "Simple. You\u2019re a failure Eric, and your father treated you as
      such. You\u2019ve been failing to run the business, and as a result, he had
      taken it away from you. So you killed him."
  - character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 3892af64df0c32e4888b1024fde5acf3, type: 2}
    sentence: "I tried my best, and it still wasn\u2019t good enough for him!"

    sentence: "And then there\u2019s the question of your sister. The motive for
      that is simple. Jealousy. Your sister was always the favoured child, so when
      you decided to kill your father, you also decided to be rid of her. You used
      the secret tunnels that only you and her knew about to leave the outhouse without
      being seen."

    sentence: "The final question was what you wanted with the staff. And again the
      answer is obvious. You wanted to spite your father. By taking his life\u2019s
      work. By taking from him the one thing that took him away from you for all
      these years. This was your ultimate revenge, to destroy the staff."
  - character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 3892af64df0c32e4888b1024fde5acf3, type: 2}
    sentence: "My ultimate revenge? This story is insane! I didn\u2019t kill father,
      you have to believe me mother!"
  - character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 19d27bb4ef9945549930bf1b387fd035, type: 2}
    sentence: Eric? How could you?

      how could you?!
