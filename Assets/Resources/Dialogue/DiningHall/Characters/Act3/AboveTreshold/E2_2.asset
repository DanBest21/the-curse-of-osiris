  - character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 62067f6e33a936f408b5813710f123b2, type: 2}
    sentence: Your sister was last seen in the outhouse, and nobody saw her or the
      kidnapper leave. Do you have any idea how they could have left without anyone
      noticing?
  - character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 3892af64df0c32e4888b1024fde5acf3, type: 2}
    sentence: "How they left the outhouse? Why is that the question you\u2026 Wait,
      of course! The secret tunnels!"
  - character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 62067f6e33a936f408b5813710f123b2, type: 2}
    sentence: Secret tunnels?
  - character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 3892af64df0c32e4888b1024fde5acf3, type: 2}
    sentence: Yes, the secret tunnels. Back when this house was built in the Victorian
      era, tunnels were built across the various parts of the house to allow servants
      to travel without disturbing their masters.
  - character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 62067f6e33a936f408b5813710f123b2, type: 2}
    sentence: How demeaning.
  - character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 3892af64df0c32e4888b1024fde5acf3, type: 2}
    sentence: Yes, which is why they eventually became lost to the annals of time.
      But our old butler, Michael, showed them to me and my sister when we were kids.
  - character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 3892af64df0c32e4888b1024fde5acf3, type: 2}
    sentence: Oh, we used to drive mother and father mad by using them to traverse
      the house and confusing the absolute hell of out them!
  - character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 62067f6e33a936f408b5813710f123b2, type: 2}
    sentence: "I see, so they didn\u2019t know about the tunnels?"
  - character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 3892af64df0c32e4888b1024fde5acf3, type: 2}
    sentence: No. As far as I know, only me, my sister, and our dear old butler Michael
      knew about them. But someone must have found out about them and used them to
      escape.
  - character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 3892af64df0c32e4888b1024fde5acf3, type: 2}
    sentence: The outhouse is built on top of the old servant quarters after all,
      meaning there is a tunnel there somewhere.
  - character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 62067f6e33a936f408b5813710f123b2, type: 2}
    sentence: Thanks for the tip Eric. This information could crack the case wide-open.
  - character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 3892af64df0c32e4888b1024fde5acf3, type: 2}
    sentence: Anything to help find my sister and avenge my father detective.
  - character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 62067f6e33a936f408b5813710f123b2, type: 2}
    sentence: Forgive me for perhaps overstepping my bounds, but it sounds like you
      and Michael were close.
  - character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 3892af64df0c32e4888b1024fde5acf3, type: 2}
    sentence: We were indeed. He was like a father to me, more so than my actual
      father. Dad was always away on archeological trips.
  - character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 62067f6e33a936f408b5813710f123b2, type: 2}
    sentence: Is that why you resent Jeffery so much?
  - character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 3892af64df0c32e4888b1024fde5acf3, type: 2}
    sentence: "I\u2026 I guess it is. I guess it\u2019s also why I disliked you so
      much at first too. But I see now that my opinions were misguided, and for that
      I am sorry."
  - character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 62067f6e33a936f408b5813710f123b2, type: 2}
    sentence: "Don\u2019t mention it Eric. Let\u2019s just focus on getting your
      sister back."
  - character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 3892af64df0c32e4888b1024fde5acf3, type: 2}
    sentence: Agreed.
