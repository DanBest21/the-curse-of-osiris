    sentence: "My friend, I hope this letter finds you well. It has been so long!
      The last time we saw each other, my oldest Eric was merely a boy. Now he\u2019s
      poised to take over my business dealings as I retire, but I digress."
  - character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 42df7a1766f033643ba6484f19d6d80a, type: 2}
    sentence: "I\u2019m reaching out to you after all this time to let you know that
      I\u2019ve finally done it, I found what we spent all those years chasing after
      \u2014 the Staff of Osiris! It truly is a splendor to behold, the very power
      of the god of death himself courses through its frame!"
  - character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 42df7a1766f033643ba6484f19d6d80a, type: 2}
    sentence: "We were looking in the wrong place all this time old friend, long
      had it left the Valley of the Kings. I traced its steps after it left Egypt
      \u2014 the Achaemenids, the Greeks, the Romans, the Byzantines, and finally
      the Ottomans."
  - character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 42df7a1766f033643ba6484f19d6d80a, type: 2}
    sentence: "It is quite remarkable that all this time, it was hidden in plain
      sight \u2014 on display in the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul. It took quite some
      convincing (and a lot of money!) to get the Turkish authorities to part with
      it."
  - character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 42df7a1766f033643ba6484f19d6d80a, type: 2}
    sentence: "You simply must come to my manor and see it for yourself. After the
      many years we spent on its trail in Egypt, I\u2019m sure you could not resist
      coming to see it."
  - character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 42df7a1766f033643ba6484f19d6d80a, type: 2}
    sentence: Oh, and pay no mind to those ridiculous stories we heard from locals
      back in the day, my possession of it has not caused me to just magically fall
      over and die!
  - character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 42df7a1766f033643ba6484f19d6d80a, type: 2}
    sentence: I look forward to seeing you after all these years soon.
  - character: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 42df7a1766f033643ba6484f19d6d80a, type: 2}
    sentence: Your friend, Henry.
